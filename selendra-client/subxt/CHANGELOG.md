## [0.28.0] - 2022-04-11

This is a fairly significant change; what follows is a description of the main changes to be aware of:

### Unify how we encode and decode static and dynamic types ([#842](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/842))

Prior to this, static types generated by codegen (ie subxt macro) would implement `Encode` and `Decode` from the `parity-scale-codec` library. This meant that they woule be encoded-to and decoded-from based on their shape. Dynamic types (eg the `subxt::dynamic::Value` type) would be encoded and decoded based on the node metadata instead.

This change makes use of the new `scale-encode` and `scale-decode` crates to auto-implement `EncodeAsType` and `DecodeAsType` on all of our static types. These traits allow types to take the node metadata into account when working out how best to encode and decode into them. By using metadata, we can be much more flexible/robust about how to encode/decode various types (as an example, nested transactions will now be portable across runtimes). Additionally, we can merge our codepaths for static and dynamic encoding/decoding, since both static and dynamic types can implement these traits. Read [the PR description](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/842) for more info.

A notable impact of this is that any types you wish to substitute when performing codegen (via the CLI tool or `#[subxt]` macro) must also implement `EncodeAsType` and `DecodeAsType` too. Substrate types, for instance, generally do not. To work around this, [#886](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/886) introduces a `Static` type and enhances the type substitution logic so that you're able to wrap any types which only implement `Encode` and `Decode` to work (note that you lose out on the improvements from `EncodeAsType` and `DecodeAsType` when you do this):

```rust
#[subxt::subxt(
    runtime_metadata_path = "/path/to/metadata.scale",
    substitute_type(
        type = "sp_runtime::multiaddress::MultiAddress<A, B>",
        with = "::subxt::utils::Static<::sp_runtime::multiaddress::MultiAddress<A, B>>"
    )
)]
pub mod node_runtime {}
```

So, if you want to substitute in Substrate types, wrap them in `::subxt::utils::Static` in the type substitution, as above. [#886](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/886) also generally improves type substitution so that you can substitute the generic params in nested types, since it's required in the above.

Several types have been renamed as a result of this unification (though they aren't commonly made explicit use of). Additionally, to obtain the bytes from a storage address, instead of doing:

```rust
let addr_bytes = storage_address.to_bytes()
```

You must now do:

```rust
let addr_bytes = cxt.client().storage().address_bytes(&storage_address).unwrap();
```

This is because the address on it's own no longer requires as much static information, and relies more heavily now on the node metadata to encode it to bytes.

### Expose Signer payload ([#861](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/861))

This is not a breaking change, but notable in that is adds `create_partial_signed_with_nonce` and `create_partial_signed` to the `TxClient` to allow you to break extrinsic creation into two steps:

1. building a payload, and then
2. when a signature is provided, getting back an extrinsic ready to be submitted.

This allows a signer payload to be obtained from Subxt, handed off to some external application, and then once a signature has been obtained, that can be passed back to Subxt to complete the creation of an extrinsic. This opens the door to using browser wallet extensions, for instance, to sign Subxt payloads.

### Stripping unneeded pallets from metadata ([#879](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/879))

This is not a breaking change, but adds the ability to use the Subxt CLI tool to strip out all but some named list of pallets from a metadata bundle. Aside from allowing you to store a significantly smaller metadata bundle with only the APIs you need in it, it will also lead to faster codegen, since there's much less of it to do.

Use a command like `subxt metadata --pallets Balances,System` to select specific pallets. You can provide an existing metadata file to take that and strip it, outputting a smaller bundle. Alternately it will grab the metadata from a local node and strip that before outputting.

### Dispatch error changes ([#878](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/878))

The `DispatchError` returned from either attempting to submit an extrinsic, or from calling `.dry_run()` has changed. It's now far more complete with respect to the information it returns in each case, and the interface has been tidied up. Changes include:

- For `ModuleError`'s, instead of `err.pallet` and `err.error`, you can obtain error details using `let details = err.details()?` and then `details.pallet()` and `details.error()`.
- `DryRunResult` is now a custom enum with 3 states, `Success`, `DispatchError` or `TransactionValidityError`. The middle of these contains much more information than previously.
- Errors in general have been marked `#[non_exahustive]` since they could grow and change at any time. (Owing to our use of `scale-decode` internally, we are not so contrained when it comes to having precise variant indexes or anything now, and can potentially deprecate rather than remove old variants as needed).
- On a lower level, the `rpc.dry_run()` RPC call now returns the raw dry run bytes which can then be decoded with the help of metadata into our `DryRunResult`.

### Extrinsic submission changes ([#897](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/897))

It was found by [@furoxr](https://github.com/furoxr) that Substrate nodes will stop sending transaction progress events under more circumstances than we originally expected. Thus, now calls like `wait_for_finalized()` and `wait_for_in_block()` will stop waiting for events when any of the following is sent from the node:

- `Usurped`
- `Finalized`
- `FinalityTimeout`
- `Invalid`
- `Dropped`

Previously we'd only close the subscription and stop waiting when we saw a `Finalized` or `FinalityTimeout` event. Thanks for digging into this [@furoxr](https://github.com/furoxr)!

### Add `at_latest()` method ([#900](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/900) and [#904](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/904))

A small breaking change; previously we had `.at(None)` or `.at(Some(block_hash))` methods in a few places to obtain things at either the latest block or some specific block hash.

This API has been clarified; we now have `.at_latest()` to obtain the thing at the latest block, or `.at(block_hash)` (note; no more option) to obtain the thing at some fixed block hash. In a few instances this has allowed us to ditch the `async` from the `.at()` call.

That covers the larger changes in this release. For more details, have a look at all of the notable PRs since the last release here:

## [0.27.1] - 2022-02-15

### Added

- Add `find_last` for block types ([#825](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/825))

## [0.27.0] - 2022-02-13

This is a fairly small release, primarily to bump substrate dependencies to their latest versions.

The main breaking change is fairly small: [#804](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/804). Here, the `BlockNumber` associated type has been removed from `Config` entirely, since it wasn't actually needed anywhere in Subxt. Additionally, the constraints on each of those associated types in `Config` were made more precise, primarily to tidy things up (but this should result in types more easily being able to meet the requirements here). If you use custom `Config`, the fix is simply to remove the `BlockNumber` type. If you also use the `Config` trait in your own functions and depend on those constraints, you may be able to define a custom `MyConfig` type which builds off `Config` and adds back any additional bounds that you want.

Note worthy PRs merged since the last release:

### Added

- Add find last function ([#821](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/821))
- Doc: first item is current version comment ([#817](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/817))

### Changed

- Remove unneeded Config bounds and BlockNumber associated type ([#804](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/804))


## [0.26.0] - 2022-01-24

This release adds a number of improvements, most notably:

- We make Substrate dependencies optional ([#760](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/760)), which makes WASM builds both smaller and more reliable. To do this, we re-implement some core types like `AccountId32`, `MultiAddress` and `MultiSignature` internally.
- Allow access to storage entries ([#774](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/774)) and runtime API's ([#777](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/777)) from some block. This is part of a move towards a more "block centric" interface, which will better align with the newly available `chainHead` style RPC interface.
- Add RPC methods for the new `chainHead` style interface (see https://paritytech.github.io/json-rpc-interface-spec/). These are currently unstable, but will allow users to start experimenting with this new API if their nodes support it.
- More advanced type substitution is now possible in the codegen interface ([#735](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/735)).

This release introduces a number of breaking changes that can be generally be fixed with mechanical tweaks to your code. The notable changes are described below.

### Make Storage API more Block-centric

See [#774](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/774). This PR makes the Storage API more consistent with the Events API, and allows access to it from a given block as part of a push to provide a more block centric API that will hopefully be easier to understand, and will align with the new RPC `chainHead` style RPC interface.

Before, your code will look like:

```rust
let a = api.storage().fetch(&staking_bonded, None).await?;
```

After, it should look like:

```rust
let a = api.storage().at(None).await?.fetch(&staking_bonded).await?;
```

Essentially, the final parameter for choosing which block to call some method at has been moved out of the storage method itself and is now provided to instantiate the storage API, either explicitly via an `.at(optional_block_hash)` as above, or implicitly when calling `block.storage()` to access the same storage methods for some block.

An alternate way to access the same storage (primarily used if you have subscribed to blocks or otherwise are working with some block) now is:

```rust
let block = api.blocks().at(None).await?
let a = block.storage().fetch(&staking_bonded, None).await?;
```

### More advanced type substitution in codegen

See [#735](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/735). Previously, you could perform basic type substitution like this:

```rust
#[subxt::subxt(runtime_metadata_path = "../polkadot_metadata.scale")]
pub mod node_runtime {
    #[subxt::subxt(substitute_type = "sp_arithmetic::per_things::Foo")]
    use crate::Foo;
}
```

This example would use `crate::Foo` every time an `sp_arithmetic::per_things::Foo` was encountered in the codegen. However, this was limited; the substitute type had to have the name number and order of generic parameters for this to work.

We've changed the interface above into:

```rust
#[subxt::subxt(
    runtime_metadata_path = "../polkadot_metadata.scale",
    substitute_type(
        type = "sp_arithmetic::per_things::Foo<A, B, C>",
        with = "crate::Foo<C>"
    )
)]
pub mod node_runtime {}
```

In this example, we can (optionally) specify the generic parameters we expect to see on the original type ("type"), and then of those, decide which should be present on the substitute type ("with"). If no parameters are provided at all, we'll get the same behaviour as before. This allows much more flexibility when defining substitute types.

### Optional Substrate dependencies

See [#760](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/760). Subxt now has a "substrate-compat" feature (enabled by default, and disabled for WASM builds). At present, enabling this feature simply exposes the `PairSigner` (which was always available before), allowing transactions to be signed via Substrate signer logic (as before). When disabled, you (currently) must bring your own signer implementation, but in return we can avoid bringing in a substantial number of Substrate dependencies in the process.

Regardless, this change also tidied up and moved various bits and pieces around to be consistent with this goal. To address some common moves, previously we'd have:

```rust
use subxt::{
    ext::{
        sp_core::{ sr25519, Pair },
        sp_runtime::{ AccountId32, generic::Header },
    },
    tx::{
        Era,
        PlainTip,
        PolkadotExtrinsicParamsBuilder
    }
};
```

And now this would look more like:

```rust
// `sp_core` and `sp_runtime` are no longer exposed via `ext`; add the crates yourself at matching versions to use:
use sp_core::{
    sr25519,
    Pair,
};
use subxt::{
    // You'll often want to use the "built-in" `AccountId32` now instead of the `sp_runtime` version:
    utils::AccountId32,
    // traits used in our `Config` trait are now provided directly in this module:
    config::Header,
    // Polkadot and Substrate specific Config types are now in the relevant Config section:
    config::polkadot::{
        Era,
        PlainTip,
        PolkadotExtrinsicParamsBuilder
    }
}
```

Additionally, the `type Hashing` in the `Config` trait is now called `Hasher`, to clarify what it is, and types returned directly from the RPC calls now all live in `crate::rpc::types`, rather than sometimes living in Substrate crates.

## [0.24.0] - 2022-09-22

This release has a bunch of smaller changes and fixes. The breaking changes are fairly minor and should be easy to address if encountered. Notable additions are:
- Allowing the underlying RPC implementation to be swapped out ([#634](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/634)). This makes `jsonrpsee` an optional dependency, and opens the door for Subxt to be integrated into things like light clients, since we can decide how to handle RPC calls.
- A low level "runtime upgrade" API is exposed, giving more visibility into when node updates happen in case your application needs to handle them.
- `scale-value` and `scale-decode` dependencies are bumped. The main effect of this is that `bitvec` is no longer used under the hood in the core of Subxt, which helps to remove one hurdle on the way to being able to compile it to WASM.

Notable PRs merged:

### Added

- feat: add low-level `runtime upgrade API` ([#657](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/657))

## [0.23.0] - 2022-08-11

This is one of the most significant releases to date in Subxt, and carries with it a number of significant breaking changes, but in exchange, a number of significant improvements. The most significant PR is [#593](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/593); the fundamental change that this makes is to separate creating a query/transaction/address from submitting it. This gives us flexibility when creating queries; they can be either dynamically or statically generated, but also flexibility in our client, enabling methods to be exposed for online or offline use.

The best place to look to get a feel for what's changed, aside from the documentation itself, is the `examples` folder. What follows are some examples of the changes you'll need to make, which all follow a similar pattern:

### Submitting a transaction

Previously, we'd build a client which is tied to the static codegen, and then use the client to build and submit a transaction like so:

```rust
let api = ClientBuilder::new()
    .build()
    .await?
    .to_runtime_api::<polkadot::RuntimeApi<DefaultConfig, PolkadotExtrinsicParams<_>>>();

let balance_transfer = api
    .tx()
    .balances()
    .transfer(dest, 10_000)?
    .sign_and_submit_then_watch_default(&signer)
    .await?
    .wait_for_finalized_success()
    .await?;
```

Now, we build a transaction separately (in this case, using static codegen to guide us as before) and then submit it to a client like so:

``` rust
let api = OnlineClient::<PolkadotConfig>::new().await?;

let balance_transfer_tx = polkadot::tx().balances().transfer(dest, 10_000);

let balance_transfer = api
    .tx()
    .sign_and_submit_then_watch_default(&balance_transfer_tx, &signer)
    .await?
    .wait_for_finalized_success()
    .await?;
```

See the `examples/examples/submit_and_watch.rs` example for more.

### Fetching a storage entry

Previously, we build and submit a storage query in one step:

```rust
let api = ClientBuilder::new()
    .build()
    .await?
    .to_runtime_api::<polkadot::RuntimeApi<DefaultConfig, PolkadotExtrinsicParams<DefaultConfig>>>();

let entry = api.storage().staking().bonded(&addr, None).await;
```

Now, we build the storage query separately and submit it to the client:

```rust
let api = OnlineClient::<PolkadotConfig>::new().await?;

let staking_bonded = polkadot::storage().staking().bonded(&addr);

let entry = api.storage().fetch(&staking_bonded, None).await;
```

Note that previously, the generated code would do the equivalent of `fetch_or_default` if possible, or `fetch` if no default existed. You must now decide whether to:
- fetch an entry, returning `None` if it's not found (`api.storage().fetch(..)`), or
- fetch an entry, returning the default if it's not found (`api.storage().fetch_or_default(..)`).

The static types will protect you against using `fetch_or_default` when no such default exists, and so the recommendation is to try changing all storage requests to use `fetch_or_default`, falling back to using `fetch` where doing so leads to compile errors.

See `examples/examples/concurrent_storage_requests.rs` for an example of fetching entries.

### Iterating over storage entries

Previously:

```rust
let api = ClientBuilder::new()
    .build()
    .await?
    .to_runtime_api::<polkadot::RuntimeApi<DefaultConfig, PolkadotExtrinsicParams<DefaultConfig>>>();

let mut iter = api
    .storage()
    .xcm_pallet()
    .version_notifiers_iter(None)
    .await?;

while let Some((key, value)) = iter.next().await? {
    // ...
}
```

Now, as before, building the storage query to iterate over is separate from using it:

```rust
let api = OnlineClient::<PolkadotConfig>::new().await?;

let key_addr = polkadot::storage()
    .xcm_pallet()
    .version_notifiers_root();

let mut iter = api
    .storage()
    .iter(key_addr, 10, None).await?;

while let Some((key, value)) = iter.next().await? {
    // ...
}
```

Note that the `_root()` suffix on generated storage queries accesses the root entry at that address,
and is available when the address is a map that can be iterated over. By not appending `_root()`, you'll
be asked to provide the values needed to access a specific entry in the map.

See the `examples/examples/storage_iterating.rs` example for more.

### Accessing constants

Before, we'd build a client and use the client to select and query a constant:

```rust
let api = ClientBuilder::new()
    .build()
    .await?
    .to_runtime_api::<polkadot::RuntimeApi<DefaultConfig, PolkadotExtrinsicParams<DefaultConfig>>>();

let existential_deposit = api
    .constants()
    .balances()
    .existential_deposit()?;
```

Now, similar to the other examples, we separately build a constant _address_ and provide that address to the client to look it up:

```rust
let api = OnlineClient::<PolkadotConfig>::new().await?;

let address = polkadot::constants()
    .balances()
    .existential_deposit();

let existential_deposit = api.constants().at(&address)?;
```

See the `examples/examples/fetch_constants.rs` example for more.

### Subscribing to events

Event subscriptions themselves are relatively unchanged (although the data you can access/get back has changed a little). Before:

```rust
let api = ClientBuilder::new()
    .build()
    .await?
    .to_runtime_api::<polkadot::RuntimeApi<DefaultConfig, PolkadotExtrinsicParams<DefaultConfig>>>();

let mut event_sub = api.events().subscribe().await?;

while let Some(events) = event_sub.next().await {
    // ...
}
```

Now, we simply swap the client out for our new one, and the rest is similar:

```rust
let api = OnlineClient::<PolkadotConfig>::new().await?;

let mut event_sub = api.events().subscribe().await?;

while let Some(events) = event_sub.next().await {
    // ...
}
```

Note that when working with a single event, the method `event.bytes()` previously returned just the bytes associated with the event fields. Now, `event.bytes()` returns _all_ of the bytes associated with the event. There is a separate method, `event.field_bytes()`, that returns the bytes for just the fields in the event. This change will **not** lead to a compile error, and so it's worth keeping an eye out for any uses of `.bytes()` to update them to `.field_bytes()`.

See the `examples/examples/subscribe_all_events.rs` example for more.


The general pattern, as seen above, is that we break apart constructing a query/address and using it. You can now construct queries dynamically instead and forego all static codegen by using the functionality exposed in the `subxt::dynamic` module instead.

Other smaller breaking changes have happened, but they should be easier to address by following compile errors.

## [0.22.0] - 2022-06-20

With this release, subxt can subscribe to the node's runtime upgrades to ensure that the metadata is updated and
extrinsics are properly constructed.

We have also made some slight API improvements to make in the area of storage keys, and thanks to an external contribution we now support dry running transactions before submitting them.

This release also improves the documentation, adds UI tests, and defaults the `subxt-cli` to return metadata
bytes instead of the JSON format.

### Fixed

- Fix documentation examples ([#568](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/568))
- Fix cargo clippy ([#548](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/548))
- fix: Find substrate port on different log lines ([#536](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/536))

- Bump jsonrpsee ([#528](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/528))


## [0.21.0] - 2022-05-02

This release adds static metadata validation, via comparing the statically generated API with the target node's runtime
metadata. This implies a breaking change in the subxt API, as the user receives an error when interacting with an
incompatible API at the storage, call, and constant level.

The `subxt-cli` can check the compatibility of multiple runtime nodes, either full metadata compatibility or
compatibility at the pallet level.

Users can define custom derives for specific generated types of the API via adding the `derive_for_type` configuration
to the `subxt` attribute.

The metadata documentation is propagated to the statically generated API.

Previously developers wanting to build the subxt crate needed the `substrate` binary dependency in their local
environment. This restriction is removed via moving the integration tests to a dedicated crate.

The number of dependencies is reduced for individual subxt crates.

### Fixed
- test-runtime: Add exponential backoff ([#518](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/518))

### Added

- Add custom derives for specific generated types ([#520](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/520))

- Propagate documentation to runtime API ([#511](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/511))

- Add system health rpc ([#510](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/510))

### Changed
- Put integration tests behind feature flag ([#515](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/515))
- Use minimum amount of dependencies for crates ([#524](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/524))
- Export `BaseExtrinsicParams` ([#516](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/516))
- bump jsonrpsee to v0.10.1 ([#504](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/504))


## [0.20.0] - 2022-04-06

The most significant change in this release is how we create and sign extrinsics, and how we manage the
"additional" and "extra" data that is attached to them. See https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/issues/477, and the
associated PR https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/490 for a more detailed look at the code changes.

If you're targeting a node with compatible additional and extra transaction data to Substrate or Polkadot, the main
change you'll have to make is to import and use `subxt::PolkadotExtrinsicParams` or `subxt::SubstrateExtrinsicParams`
instead of `subxt::DefaultExtra` (depending on what node you're compatible with), and then use `sign_and_submit_default`
instead of `sign_and_submit` when making a call. Now, `sign_and_submit` accepts a second argument which allows these
parameters (such as mortality and tip payment) to be customized. See `examples/balance_transfer_with_params.rs` for a
small usage example.

If you're targeting a node which involves custom additional and extra transaction data, you'll need to implement the
trait `subxt::extrinsic::ExtrinsicParams`, which determines the parameters that can be provided to `sign_and_submit`, as
well as how to encode these into the "additional" and "extra" data needed for a transaction. Have a look at
`subxt/src/extrinsic/params.rs` for the trait definition and Substrate/Polkadot implementations. The aim with this change
is to make it easier to customise this for your own chains, and provide a simple way to provide values at runtime.
