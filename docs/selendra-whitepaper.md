# Selendra: A Substrate-Based Blockchain Network with Hybrid Consensus

## Abstract

Selendra is a blockchain network that provides Cambodian users with access to open blockchain ecosystems. Built on Substrate, it combines Aura for 1-second block production with AlephBFT for deterministic finality. The network is EVM compatible and supports WebAssembly, allowing existing Ethereum smart contracts to operate alongside high-performance applications. Transactions are verified through Proof of Stake with costs at approximately $0.00025 (1 KHR). This architecture provides a foundation for asset tokenization, loyalty systems, document verification, and stablecoin deployment while enabling cross-chain transfers.

## 1. Introduction

Cambodia presents a unique technological environment with high digital adoption (94% internet penetration) but limited financial inclusion (33% formal banking access). This creates a paradoxical situation where technological readiness exists without corresponding financial infrastructure. Traditional approaches to financial inclusion face significant challenges in this environment, including high implementation costs, limited interoperability, and regulatory complexity.

Blockchain technology enables decentralized agreement on transaction validity without relying on central authorities. Bitcoin [1] introduced this concept for peer-to-peer electronic cash using proof-of-work consensus. Ethereum [2] expanded the model with programmable smart contracts. However, these systems face limitations in transaction throughput, energy efficiency, and specialized application support that restrict their utility for Cambodia's specific needs.

Selendra addresses these limitations through a purpose-built blockchain architecture that combines:

1. A hybrid consensus mechanism optimized for performance and security
2. Dual execution environments supporting both EVM and WASM contracts
3. Native interoperability with existing financial systems
4. Application-specific optimizations for Cambodia's priority sectors

This paper describes Selendra's technical architecture, including its consensus mechanism, execution environments, security model, and application frameworks. It presents performance data from the operational mainnet and outlines the development roadmap.

## 2. System Architecture

Selendra is built on Substrate [3], a modular blockchain development framework that provides the foundation for customizable runtime logic. This architecture separates the core blockchain components (networking, consensus, database) from the application-specific logic, enabling specialized optimization without compromising security or interoperability.

### 2.1 Core Components

The Selendra architecture consists of four primary layers:

1. **Networking Layer**: Implements libp2p for peer discovery, connection management, and data propagation with optimizations for Cambodia's variable network conditions.

2. **Consensus Layer**: Combines Aura (Authority Round) for block production with AlephBFT for finality, achieving deterministic transaction confirmation within 1 second.

3. **State Storage Layer**: Utilizes RocksDB with specialized pruning mechanisms to maintain performance as the chain grows, with state trie optimization for reduced storage requirements.

4. **Runtime Layer**: Implements the blockchain logic including account management, transaction processing, and smart contract execution in both EVM and WASM environments.

```

**Architecture Flow Explanation:**

1. **Applications**: Specialized frameworks at the top of the stack that support specific use cases including RWA tokenization, loyalty systems, document verification, stablecoin infrastructure (KHRt), and Bitriel wallet. Selendra Terminal serves as a unified interface that hosts Cross-Chain Bridges, NFT marketplaces, DEX protocols, DeFi applications, and DAO governance systems.

2. **Runtime Layer**: Executes blockchain logic through:

   - EVM environment for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts
   - WASM environment for high-performance contracts
   - Substrate pallets providing core functionality (balances, staking, governance, etc.)

3. **State Storage Layer**: Maintains the blockchain state using a modified Merkle-Patricia Trie structure with RocksDB as the underlying database, implementing pruning to manage chain growth.

4. **Consensus Layer**: Processes transactions and produces blocks through two complementary mechanisms:

   - Aura assigns block production slots to validators in a deterministic sequence
   - AlephBFT provides fast, deterministic finality through DAG-based consensus

5. **Networking Layer**: Handles peer-to-peer communication using libp2p, managing connections between nodes and optimizing data propagation across the network.

6. **Selendra Architecture**: The foundational layer that provides the essential blockchain infrastructure and serves as the base for all other components.

The architecture implements a bottom-up layered design with the Selendra Architecture as the foundation, with each successive layer building upon the capabilities of the layer below it. This stack-based approach represents how blockchain functionality is constructed: starting with the core infrastructure, adding networking capabilities, implementing consensus mechanisms, managing state, executing smart contracts, and finally enabling user-facing applications at the top.

### 2.3 Network Topology

Selendra operates with three primary node types:

1. **Validator Nodes**: Participate in block production and validation, requiring staked SEL tokens and meeting minimum hardware specifications.

2. **Full Nodes**: Maintain a complete copy of the blockchain state and validate all transactions without participating in block production.

3. **Light Clients**: Verify block headers and specific transactions without storing the complete chain state, enabling mobile and resource-constrained device participation.

This tiered approach enables broad network participation while maintaining security and performance requirements for critical consensus operations.

## 3. Consensus Mechanism

Selendra implements a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines the efficiency of Aura for block production with the deterministic finality of AlephBFT.

### 3.1 Block Production (Aura)

Aura (Authority Round) provides a slot-based block production mechanism where validators take turns producing blocks in a predetermined sequence. Each validator is assigned specific time slots during which they have the exclusive right to produce a block. This approach offers:

1. Predictable block times (1 second)
2. Energy efficiency compared to proof-of-work systems
3. Simplified fork resolution through slot assignment
4. Reduced network communication overhead

The slot assignment follows a weighted round-robin algorithm based on validator stake, ensuring proportional block production opportunity while maintaining consistent block times. Selendra's implementation uses the Substrate framework's Aura pallet with custom configurations to achieve the 1-second block time, significantly faster than most blockchain networks.

### 3.2 Finality (AlephBFT)

While Aura provides efficient block production, it does not offer deterministic finality. Selendra addresses this through AlephBFT [4], a directed acyclic graph (DAG) based Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm that provides:

1. Deterministic finality within 1-2 block times
2. Byzantine fault tolerance up to 1/3 of validators
3. Reduced communication complexity through DAG structure
4. Formal security guarantees with mathematical proofs

AlephBFT operates as a finality gadget alongside Aura, confirming blocks as finalized once they have received sufficient validator attestations. This hybrid approach combines the performance benefits of Aura with the security guarantees of BFT consensus.

Selendra initially launched with GRANDPA for finality but has since migrated to AlephBFT for improved performance. The implementation includes specialized verification caches and justification mechanisms to ensure efficient validation of finalized blocks across the network, while maintaining compatibility with Substrate's networking infrastructure.

### 3.3 Validator Selection and Incentives

Validator selection in Selendra follows a Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) model where:

1. Token holders (nominators) stake SEL to support validator candidates
2. The top N validators by total stake (including nominations) form the active set
3. Block rewards are distributed proportionally to stake, with configurable commission rates
4. Slashing penalties apply for equivocation or extended unavailability

This economic model aligns validator incentives with network security while enabling participation from token holders who cannot or choose not to run validator infrastructure.

## 4. Execution Environment

Selendra supports dual execution environments to balance compatibility with performance:

### 4.1 EVM Compatibility Layer

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility layer enables deployment and execution of Solidity smart contracts with minimal modification. This implementation:

1. Supports the complete EVM instruction set
2. Maintains compatibility with Ethereum development tools
3. Enables direct migration of existing Ethereum applications
4. Provides Web3 API compatibility for frontend integration

The EVM layer is implemented using Frontier, a Substrate-based Ethereum compatibility layer that translates EVM execution into the underlying Substrate state transitions. This integration maintains security while providing compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. Selendra's implementation includes custom precompiles for enhanced functionality and optimized gas pricing to align with the network's fee model.

### 4.2 WebAssembly Support

For applications requiring higher performance or specialized functionality, Selendra supports WebAssembly (WASM) smart contracts through:

1. A specialized WASM virtual machine optimized for blockchain execution
2. Support for contracts written in Rust, AssemblyScript, and other WASM-compatible languages
3. Deterministic execution with metered gas consumption
4. Enhanced performance for computation-intensive applications

Selendra's WASM implementation leverages Substrate's contracts pallet with custom optimizations for the network's specific requirements. The runtime includes specialized APIs for WASM contract interaction and a comprehensive testing framework for contract verification. The implementation supports ink!, a Rust-based domain-specific language for WASM smart contracts that provides a more ergonomic development experience while maintaining the performance benefits of WebAssembly.

WASM contracts are designed to provide performance advantages over EVM for computation-intensive operations, with potential improvements in execution speed and gas efficiency for equivalent operations. Specific benchmarks for Selendra's implementation are in development.

### 4.3 State Management

Both execution environments interact with Selendra's state storage layer, which implements:

1. A modified Merkle-Patricia Trie for efficient state verification
2. RocksDB as the underlying key-value store
3. State pruning to limit storage growth
4. Optimistic execution for improved transaction throughput

This unified state approach ensures consistent security properties across both execution environments while maintaining the distinct programming models and capabilities of each.

## 5. Network Economics

Selendra's economic model balances security, sustainability, and accessibility:

### 5.1 Native Token (SEL)

The SEL token serves multiple functions within the network:

1. Stake for validator participation and security
2. Transaction fee payment
3. Governance participation
4. Protocol-level incentives for desired behaviors

The token supply follows a programmed issuance schedule with:

1. Initial genesis allocation for early contributors and development
2. Ongoing issuance through validator rewards at a declining rate
3. Transaction fee burning to offset issuance
4. Treasury allocation for ongoing development

This model balances the need for initial adoption incentives with long-term value stability.

### 5.2 Transaction Fee Model

Selendra implements a weight-based fee calculation that:

1. Charges based on computational complexity and state impact
2. Targets transaction costs of approximately $0.00025 (1 KHR) for standard operations
3. Utilizes basic fee adjustment mechanisms based on network utilization
4. Plans to implement advanced fee stability mechanisms in future updates

The current fee calculation uses a specialized `DivideFeeBy<10>` implementation for both weight and length components, effectively reducing the raw computational cost by a factor of 10 to achieve the target fee level. The `TargetedFeeAdjustment` mechanism adjusts the fee multiplier based on block utilization to help manage network congestion.

Future updates will introduce enhanced fee stability mechanisms designed to maintain consistent transaction costs despite token price volatility. Additional planned features include fee delegation capabilities for application developers, allowing dApps to cover transaction costs for their users.

This approach aims to ensure the network remains accessible for Cambodian users while maintaining economic security against spam and denial-of-service attacks. The transaction payment pallet also supports operational fee multipliers for priority transactions and treasury redirection for fee distribution.

## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1 Threat Models

Selendra's security design addresses several threat categories:

1. **Consensus Attacks**: Protected through hybrid consensus with economic penalties
2. **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Mitigated through formal verification and security audits
3. **Network-Level Attacks**: Defended through peer scoring and bandwidth management
4. **Governance Attacks**: Prevented through time-locked execution and emergency mechanisms

Each threat model includes specific detection mechanisms, mitigation strategies, and recovery procedures.

### 6.2 Formal Verification

Critical components of Selendra undergo formal verification using:

1. TLA+ specifications for consensus logic
2. Rust's type system and ownership model for runtime safety
3. Model checking for state transition correctness
4. Symbolic execution for smart contract analysis

This multi-layered approach provides mathematical guarantees for critical security properties beyond traditional testing methodologies.

### 6.3 Governance Security

Selendra implements a phased governance model with:

1. Initial technical committee oversight for critical parameters
2. Graduated transition to token-weighted voting
3. Time-locked execution for security-critical changes
4. Emergency response mechanisms for critical vulnerabilities

This approach balances security with community participation, providing protection against governance attacks while enabling stakeholder direction of network evolution.

## 7. Network Governance

Selendra's governance system is designed to enable decentralized decision-making while maintaining operational security and efficiency.

### 7.1 Governance Structure

The governance structure consists of several components working together:

1. **Token Holders**: SEL token holders can participate in governance by voting on proposals
2. **Technical Committee**: A group of technical experts responsible for evaluating and fast-tracking technical proposals
3. **Council**: Elected representatives who can propose changes and filter community proposals
4. **Treasury**: A pool of funds controlled by governance for funding development and community initiatives

### 7.2 Proposal Process

The proposal process follows these steps:

1. **Proposal Submission**: Any token holder can submit a proposal by bonding a minimum amount of SEL
2. **Discussion Period**: Community discussion and deliberation on the proposal
3. **Voting Period**: Token holders vote on the proposal with votes weighted by token holdings
4. **Execution**: If approved, proposals are executed after a predetermined delay period

### 7.3 Voting Mechanism

Selendra uses a conviction voting system where:

1. Votes can be locked for longer periods to gain greater voting power
2. Conviction levels range from 0.1x to 6x voting power based on lock duration
3. This mechanism encourages long-term alignment with network success

### 7.4 Parameter Governance

Governance can modify various network parameters including:

1. Validator rewards and slashing conditions
2. Transaction fee adjustments
3. Treasury spending proposals
4. Runtime upgrades for protocol enhancements

### 7.5 Security Measures

To protect against governance attacks, Selendra implements:

1. **Time Locks**: Enforced delays between approval and execution of sensitive changes
2. **Supermajority Requirements**: Higher approval thresholds for critical changes
3. **Technical Veto**: The technical committee can veto dangerous proposals
4. **Emergency Actions**: Fast-track procedures for critical security fixes
