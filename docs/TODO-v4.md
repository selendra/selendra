# Selendra Network v4: Development Roadmap

**Version 1.0**  
**Date: July 2025**

## What We're Building

Selendra v4 aims to reduce barriers that prevent regular people from using blockchain technology. We're transforming every account into a smart contract that supports:

- **No lost keys**: Family and friends can help recover accounts
- **No gas fees**: Applications pay fees for users
- **Simple interactions**: Session keys for seamless app usage
- **Faster transactions**: Process multiple transactions at the same time
- **Open network**: Anyone can become a validator

## Current State (v3)

**What we have:**
- Smart contract accounts with guardian recovery
- 400-800 TPS with 1-second deterministic blocks
- Sub-cent transaction fees with merchant sponsorship
- Dual EVM and WebAssembly runtime environments
- AlephBFT mathematical finality in 2-3 seconds
- Network uptime: >99.9% since mainnet launch
- Currently 50+ validators across 6 continents
- Transaction cost: Consistently under $0.000015 USD

**What needs improvement:**
- User experience complexity limits broader adoption
- Network validator participation is limited
- Transaction processing could be faster
- Private key management creates barriers
