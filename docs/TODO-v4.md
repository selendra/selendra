# Selendra Network v4: Development Roadmap

**Version 1.0**  
**Date: January 2025**

## What We're Building

Selendra v4 aims to reduce barriers that prevent regular people from using blockchain technology. We're transforming every account into a smart contract that supports:

- **No lost keys**: Family and friends can help recover accounts
- **No gas fees**: Applications pay fees for users
- **Simple interactions**: Session keys for seamless app usage
- **Faster transactions**: Process multiple transactions at the same time
- **Open network**: Anyone can become a validator

## Current State (v3)

**What we have:**
- 1-second block times
- EVM and WASM smart contracts
- Basic staking system
- Limited to 400-800 transactions per second
- Requires permission to become validator
- Users must manage private keys

**What needs improvement:**
- User experience complexity limits broader adoption
- Network validator participation is limited
- Transaction processing could be faster
- Private key management creates barriers
