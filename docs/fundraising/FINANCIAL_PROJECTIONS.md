| **Bull Case** | 5M | $0.008 | $14.6M | $12.6M ✅ |

**Break-Even Daily Txs**: ~1.5M at $0.004 avg fee

---

### TVL Sensitivity

| Scenario | TVL (Y3) | FDV (3x) | Token Price | Seed Return |
|----------|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Bear Case** | $50M | $150M | $0.47 | 23x |

## Risk-Adjusted DCF (Discounted Cash Flow)

### Methodology

**Discount Rate**: 50% (early-stage crypto project risk)
**Terminal Value**: 20x Year 3 EBITDA
**Probability-Weighted Scenarios**

| Scenario | Probability | Year 3 EBITDA | Terminal Value | PV (Present Value) |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Bear** | 30% | ($500K) | $0 | $0 |
| **Base** | 50% | $2.5M | $50M | $14.8M |
| **Bull** | 20% | $13M | $260M | $77M |

**Weighted Average PV**: (0.3 × $0) + (0.5 × $14.8M) + (0.2 × $77M) = **$22.8M**

**Fair Value at Seed**: $22.8M / (1.5^3) = **$6.75M FDV**

**Seed Round at $6.5M FDV**: Slightly undervalued (4% upside)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Revenue**: $88K (Y1) → $657K (Y2) → $4.38M (Y3)
2. **Profitability**: Break-even Year 3, Month 6
3. **TVL**: $10M (Y1) → $75M (Y2) → $300M (Y3)
4. **Token Price**: $0.02 (Seed) → $0.31 (Y1) → $2.81 (Y3)
5. **Seed ROI**: 15x (Y1), 46x (Y2), 138x (Y3)
6. **Valuation**: $6.5M (Seed) → $100M (Y1) → $900M (Y3)
7. **Risk-Adjusted**: Fair value at Seed is $6.75M (model supports $6.5M ask)

**Investment Thesis**: Compelling risk-reward at Seed ($650K for 10% of potential $900M+ network)

---

**Model Confidence**: Medium-High
- Conservative transaction volume assumptions
- Proven comparable valuations (Moonbeam, Astar)
- Technology de-risked (testnet live)
- Execution risk remains (team scaling, market timing)

**Next Steps**: Refine model post-Seed based on actual mainnet metrics.
