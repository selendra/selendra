We've built a working testnet with an AI-augmented team of 4, and we're raising $650K to launch mainnet and grow to $50M TVL in 18 months. We're offering 10% at a $6.5M valuation—early investors target 15-50x returns by Year 2."

## 📋 Investor FAQ

### Q: Why this valuation?
**A**: $6.5M FDV is conservative for a working testnet with hybrid consensus. Comparable projects (Moonbeam, Astar) launched at $50M+ FDV with less technology de-risked.

### Q: What if you can't raise $650K?
**A**: We can operate with $400K (12-month runway, delayed CEX listings). Below $400K, we'd focus on grants and delay mainnet 6 months.

### Q: What's the token utility?
**A**: SEL is used for gas fees (burn mechanism), staking (10% APY), governance (voting), DeFi collateral, and validator bonds (10M SEL minimum).

### Q: When will tokens be liquid?
**A**: TGE at Month 8-10 post-Seed (mainnet launch). Initial DEX listing on Uniswap + Selendra Swap. CEX listings Month 6-12 post-TGE.

### Q: How does AI-augmented team work?
**A**: 10 specialized AI agents (Claude Code) generate 70% of code. 4 humans review and handle strategy. Proven: We shipped testnet with $3K budget.

### Q: What's the competition?
**A**: Ethereum (too slow), Solana (downtime risk), Polygon (centralized), Polkadot parachains (slot auction costs). We offer speed + security + EVM compatibility with no compromises.

### Q: What's the biggest risk?
**A**: Execution. Technology works (testnet proves it), but scaling team, growing ecosystem, and competing for developer mindshare is challenging. Mitigation: AI agents, strong advisors, focused go-to-market.
