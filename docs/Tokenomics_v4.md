# Selendra Network v4: SEL Token Economics

**Version 4.0**  
**Date: July 2025**

## Abstract

SEL is the native utility token of Selendra Network v4, supporting smart contract accounts, fee delegation, gasless transactions, and multi-token payments while maintaining network security and sustainability.

## 1. SEL Token Utilities

### Core Functions

**Network Security**: Validators stake 31,416 SEL minimum to participate in Aura + AlephBFT consensus. Token holders can delegate to validators and earn rewards. The system tolerates up to 1/3 malicious validators through economic security.

**Transaction Fees**: SEL remains the base unit for all fee calculations. Current v3 network: ~0.0005 SEL per transaction. Target v4: 0.001 SEL per transaction (~$0.000025 USD).

**Governance**: SEL holders vote on protocol upgrades, parameter changes, and treasury allocation. Staked SEL provides voting weight in governance decisions.

### Account Abstraction Features

**Paymaster Operations**: Applications register as paymasters with minimum SEL bonds to sponsor user fees. Economic structure supports fee delegation services.

**Session Keys**: Users pay 0.1 SEL to create session keys with 50% transaction fee discounts. Gaming and DeFi applications benefit from automated interactions.

**Social Recovery**: Guardian setup and recovery operations require SEL fees. Professional guardian services create incentive structures for account recovery.

## 2. Fee Architecture

### Multi-Layer System

Users can pay fees in three ways:
- **Direct SEL payment** (traditional method)
- **Multi-token payment** with automatic conversion to SEL
- **Sponsored transactions** where applications pay fees

All fees ultimately settle in SEL at the protocol layer through integrated DEX conversion.

### Fee Distribution

Transaction fees (0.001 SEL base) distribute as follows:
- **40% burned** - Creates deflationary pressure
- **35% to validators** - Security incentive  
- **15% to treasury** - Development funding
- **10% to paymaster pool** - Sponsorship incentives

### Economic Impact

At target 4,000 TPS performance:
- **Daily fees**: 345,600 SEL
- **Annual validator rewards**: 44,150,400 SEL (6x increase over inflation-only)
- **Annual burn**: 50,457,600 SEL (deflationary pressure)
- **Treasury funding**: 18,921,600 SEL annually

## 3. Business Models

### Paymaster Types

**Application Paymasters**: DApps sponsor fees for user acquisition and retention. Gaming apps cover in-game transactions; DeFi platforms offer gasless premium features.

**Subscription Paymasters**: Users pay monthly fees for gasless transactions. Predictable revenue model with SEL reserves for fee payment volatility.

**Commercial Paymasters**: Third-party services compete on conversion rates and user experience, earning revenue through fee markup or service commissions.

### Economic Viability

At 0.001 SEL per transaction:
- 1,000 sponsored transactions cost 1 SEL (~$0.025)
- Monthly budget: 100 SEL = 100,000 sponsored transactions
- Favorable lifetime value to customer acquisition cost ratios

### Session Key Economics

**Gaming Applications**: 50% fee discount (0.0005 SEL per transaction) with 0.17 SEL setup cost. Break-even at 340+ transactions per session.

**DeFi Automation**: Cost-effective for high-frequency traders (500+ trades/month). Revenue through performance and management fees.

**Social Applications**: Direct sponsorship more efficient than session keys for high-volume interactions.

## 4. Cross-Business Loyalty Programs

Each business issues tokens with defined values. A coffee shop creates 1¢ tokens while a fashion store issues 10¢ tokens. 

**Decentralized Exchange**: Dedicated applications hold token reserves, enabling swaps between different loyalty tokens. Users like Sophea can swap 50 fashion tokens ($5) for 500 coffee tokens.

**Revenue Model**: Each swap incurs 1-2% fees in points, providing sustainable revenue for exchange operators while maintaining liquidity between business tokens.

## 5. Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)
- Smart contract account implementation
- Basic paymaster infrastructure  
- 0.001 SEL base fee structure
- Session key system with 50% discounts

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Months 7-12)
- Multi-token fee payment system
- Oracle integration for USD pegging
- Advanced paymaster economics
- Cross-business loyalty token exchanges

### Phase 3: Market Maturation (Months 13-18)
- Professional guardian services marketplace
- Competitive paymaster ecosystem
- Automated fee optimization algorithms
- Full v4 feature deployment

## 6. Risk Management

### Economic Safeguards

**Paymaster Protection**: Spending limits, user verification, and rate limiting prevent fund drainage. Minimum SEL bonds ensure solvency.

**Token Conversion Safety**: 5% maximum slippage protection with circuit breakers for extreme volatility. Emergency pause mechanisms for market disruptions.

**Session Key Security**: Strict spending limits, automatic expiration, and granular permissions prevent abuse. Users can revoke keys instantly.

### Governance Controls

Network parameters are adjustable through SEL holder voting:
- Fee distribution percentages
- Paymaster minimum bonds
- Supported fee payment tokens
- Session key fee structure

## 7. Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Support 1,200-4,000 TPS through parallel processing
- Maintain 1-second blocks and 2-3 second finality
- 50% of transactions use advanced features (gasless, session keys)

### Economic Goals
- 6x validator reward increase over inflation-only model
- 50M+ SEL burned annually at target performance
- 10+ active paymaster services
- 50+ applications using v4 features

### Adoption Metrics
- 100,000+ daily active users across applications
- Functional cross-business loyalty token ecosystem
- High user satisfaction scores for gasless experiences

## 8. Conclusion

Selendra v4's tokenomics creates sustainable economics supporting smart contract accounts while maintaining network security. The multi-layered fee system enables gasless experiences, cross-business loyalty programs, and improved user onboarding.

Key features include user choice in fee payment methods, economic sustainability through multiple revenue streams, new business models for applications and service providers, and network growth through reduced friction.

This model positions Selendra for real-world business adoption while maintaining economic security and decentralization required for long-term operation.
