## 🙋‍♀️ L2 

This branch aims to enhance Selendra's position as a Layer 2 or Layer 3 solution in the Ethereum ecosystem, with a focus on Layer 3 on Starknet due to its lower transaction fees. If this approach does not succeed, Layer 2 on Ethereum will be explored.

This trial will add an extra layer of security to Selendra, enabling it to concentrate on attracting mass users through initiatives such as tokenization and loyalty rewards in collaboration with local governments, businesses, and developers.
